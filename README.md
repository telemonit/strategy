Since May, the following has been done:

### Project
+ [x] testing software for object detection in cameras

+ [x] I have prepared lists of potential projects in various models that can be taken into account when implementing the strategy
  In case of problems with making profits on video projects, there is an alternative in the form of projects for a wide range of recipients who use emails in their everyday life

+ [ ] [draftom.com](http://www.draftom.com) - generating automatic responses in the draft
+ simple editor of the message itself in the mail "draft" folder
+ simple UI and API with the possibility of integration in many global marketplaces

+ [ ] [doby.email](http://www.doby.email) - creating a task list by analyzing the content and thread of an email message

**PLAN** [<span style='font-size:20px;'>&#x270D;</span>](git@github.com:telemonit/strategy/edit/main/EN/PLAN.md)

**What determines the strategy adopted by telemonit?**

- changes in the business environment, particularly in the context of security technology and artificial intelligence, here are a few:

### Technology Status
- Rapid development of language models (LLM) and video streaming technologies opens up new possibilities for automation and data analysis.

### Competition
- Changes in EU regulations lead to market restructuring, which can create both challenges and opportunities for companies.
- There is an observed trend of shifting market power towards Asian and American companies.

### Market Niche
- There is an increasing demand for integrated, self-service security solutions, which can be an area of development for innovative companies.
- The increasing automation and use of AI in various sectors is changing the dynamics of the labor market and services.

### New Threats
- Increased risk of cyber threats, particularly in the context of data theft.
- The emergence of new types of threats, such as biological threats (CBRNe), requires new approaches to security.

These trends indicate the need for adaptation and innovation in the security and technology sectors. Companies that can effectively combine new technologies (such as AI and video analysis) with security solutions, while addressing new types of threats, can find themselves in a favorable market position.
