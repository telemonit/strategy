**PLAN** [<span style='font-size:20px;'>&#x270D;</span>](git@github.com:telemonit/strategy/edit/main/EN/PLAN.md)

**What determines the strategy adopted by telemonit?**

- changes in the business environment, particularly in the context of security technology and artificial intelligence, here are a few:

### Technology Status
- Rapid development of language models (LLM) and video streaming technologies opens up new possibilities for automation and data analysis.

### Competition
- Changes in EU regulations lead to market restructuring, which can create both challenges and opportunities for companies.
- There is an observed trend of shifting market power towards Asian and American companies.

### Market Niche
- There is an increasing demand for integrated, self-service security solutions, which can be an area of development for innovative companies.
- The increasing automation and use of AI in various sectors is changing the dynamics of the labor market and services.

### New Threats
- Increased risk of cyber threats, particularly in the context of data theft.
- The emergence of new types of threats, such as biological threats (CBRNe), requires new approaches to security.

These trends indicate the need for adaptation and innovation in the security and technology sectors. Companies that can effectively combine new technologies (such as AI and video analysis) with security solutions, while addressing new types of threats, can find themselves in a favorable market position.

**2024** [<span style='font-size:20px;'>&#x270D;</span>](git@github.com:telemonit/strategy/edit/main/EN/2024.md)

In 2024, the strategy of the telemonit company focuses on offering additional features in existing surveillance systems. By leveraging existing automation marketplaces, we are working on an API interface that will be compatible with automation systems such as IFTTT (If This Then That). It is important to note that there are many platforms and marketplaces that offer similar integration capabilities. Here is a list of such marketplaces along with a brief description: [Marketplaces for Automation and Integration with API](PL/API-INTEGRATION.md)

In addition to the API, we will need it to create mobile and web applications such as:

- [videoInspect](http://www.videoinspect.com) - Video Inspection System Analysis, Automatic Analysis, Repair, and Configuration
- [medianon](http://www.medianon.com) - Anonymization of Data in Video Materials
- [voco.camera](http://www.voco.camera) - Voice-Controlled Camera - API needed for voice communication with cameras
- [cameraMonit](http://www.cameramonit.com) - Voice-Based Camera Alerts through Various Communication Channels
- [teleoperator.app](http://www.teleoperator.app) - Application for managing and handling incidents
