**2024**

In 2024, the strategy of the telemonit company focuses on offering additional features in existing surveillance systems. By leveraging existing automation marketplaces, we are working on an API interface that will be compatible with automation systems such as IFTTT (If This Then That). It is important to note that there are many platforms and marketplaces that offer similar integration capabilities. Here is a list of such marketplaces along with a brief description: [Marketplaces for Automation and Integration with API](PL/API-INTEGRATION.md)

In addition to the API, we will need it to create mobile and web applications such as:

- [videoInspect](http://www.videoinspect.com) - Video Inspection System Analysis, Automatic Analysis, Repair, and Configuration
