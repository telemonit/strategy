**2024**

## 2024

In 2024, telemonit's strategy is to offer additional functionalities in existing monitoring systems.
Using the existing automation marketplace
We are working on an API that will be compatible with automation systems such as IFTTT (If This Then That),
it is worth understanding that there are many platforms and marketplaces that offer similar integration opportunities.
Below you will find a list of such marketplaces and their short description: [Marketplaces for Automation and API Integration](PL/API-INTEGRATION.md)

In addition, the API will be needed to create mobile and web applications such as:
+ [videoInspect](http://www.videoinspect.com) - Inspection of video materials, generating a description of events in the material
+ [medianon](http://www.medianon.com) - Anonymization of data in video materials
+ [voco.camera](http://www.voco.camera) - Voice-Controlled Camera - API needed for voice conversation with cameras
+ [cameraMonit](http://www.cameramonit.com) - Voice notification of events via various messengers
+ [surveil.camera](http://www.surveilcamera.com) - SaaS Subscription Services
+ [kamera.land](http://www.kamera.land) - Online store
+ [teleoperator.app](http://www.teleoperator.app) - Application for management and incident handling
+ [salomos](http://www.salomos.com) - Local LLM/RAG (Text to SQL) in the form of API in the SaaS model, brain for decision-making in case of incidents
